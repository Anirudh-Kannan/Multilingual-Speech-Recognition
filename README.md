## HW 2

Team Members:
- Anirudh Kannan (akannan3)
- Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy (sramamoo)

#### Steps to run the experiments
- The code for subtask 1 is present in the Sub Task 1 folder. Here the cells in the `subtask1.ipynb` file can be run sequentially in colab / gcp. An additional requirement is to copy and paste the `prep_commonvoice.py` file in the current working directory.

- For subtask 2, the code can be found in the Sub Task 2 folder. Each experiment has a corresponding notebook that contains the code. The cells just need to be run sequentially on colab / gcp to recreate the results. 
The notebooks for each experiment can be found here,
    - Experiment 1 : `Guarani Finetuning.ipynb`
    - Experiment 2 : `Italian Cross Lingual Transfer.ipynb`
    - Experiment 3 : `Mixed Training.ipynb`
    - Experiment 4 : `Test XLSR on Quechua.ipynb`
